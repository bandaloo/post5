# post5

post5 is a library for p5 that enables you to do interesting post-processing
effects with the power of WebGL2. You can build it or download it from the
"releases" section on the sidebar in GitHub. It wraps
[merge-pass](https://github.com/bandaloo/merge-pass) and
[postpre](https://github.com/bandaloo/postpre).

Check out the
[merge-pass live example](https://www.bandaloo.fun/merge-pass/example.html)
and the [postpre live example](https://www.bandaloo.fun/postpre/example.html)
to get an idea of how to nest and sequence these effects in interesting ways.
Also check out the included examples in this repo or the examples
[in the web editor](https://editor.p5js.org/bandaloo/collections/KKmpKHP-V).

To get started, all you need to do is include the `post5.js` script after
the `p5` script and before your sketch script:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/p5@1.1.9/lib/p5.js"></script>
    <script src="post5.js"></script>
    <script src="instancesketch.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

## Mappings from merge-pass and postpre to post5

This library is really just a thin wrapper for merge-pass and postpre.
(Although the default arguments for the provided functions will get you
pretty far, a number of things could be done to make this easier to use
without TypeScript and the surrounding tooling.) As mentioned previously,
check out the
[merge-pass live example](https://www.bandaloo.fun/merge-pass/example.html)
and the [postpre live example](https://www.bandaloo.fun/postpre/example.html)
for examples on how to use this library. Below is a table to keep track of
the mappings in post5; you want to use the names in the left column. Most are
just changed to camelCase, but some names had to change totally due to naming
conflicts with p5.

## Building

(This build process will be replaced with an easier one soon. postpre will be
a submodule so the build process isn't divided between two different repos.)

This repo includes `p5bundle.js` produced by the `npm run p5` script in the
postpre package available [here](https://github.com/bandaloo/postpre).
Running `sh build.sh` literally justs concatenates `p5bundle.js` with
`p5extensions.js` (which does the extending of the p5 prototype) to produce
`post5.js`. The included examples use `post5.js` so run `sh build.sh` after
making changes to `p5extensions.js`.
